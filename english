OPEN SPACE POLICY AND ETHICS

Let’s respect each other, and make the work in the same room comfortable for everyone. Please have a look at the rules for the correct behaviour in open space.

Noise 

* Do not forget to lower your voice when you are speakingl - colleagues do not always want to become members of your conversations and phone calls
* If you are listening to music, make sure that you’re the only one who can hear it
* Please switch your cell phones to silent mode

Personal conversations

* If you need to discuss anything with your colleagues or make a call, please use conference room, kitchen or hallways for that

Odors

* Do not forget that you can irritate your colleauges with bad-smelling food, excessive use of perfume or poor hygiene

Distraction from work

* All of us do not like to be distracted from work. We use a simple rule of headphones: http://thecreativespace.ca/coworking/headphone-rules/:
Please do not start conversation with a person if he has his hood on, and even avoid saying Bless you to him.


What do we do with colleagues who annoy us?

* Talk to them about the thing which is worrying you, try to focus on a particular problem and be friendly. Talk face to face and make sure that they understand that you are sincere to them and did not talk to anyone about that before. Ask them if they were aware of the fact that their behaviour is repulsive.
